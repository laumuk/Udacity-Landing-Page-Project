## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Project

Most of the programming happened in the `js/app.js` file and I also added some styling for the active states in the `styles.css` file.
Throughout the project I built the navigation dinamically as an unordered list, added active states to the sections when in the viewport and also added event listeners, so when clicked on the navigation menu the page is scrolled to the corresponding section.

## Open
To see my project, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in the browser.
